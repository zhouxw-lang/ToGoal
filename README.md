# ToGoal
ToGoal, a Chrome extension working together with Toggl Track for setting time-based goals and tracking progress

Set time-based goals like "2 hours of career development and 3 hours of planning" over a certain period like one week, and manage progress. You still need to use Toggl Track to track time and this extension reads data from Toggl Track.

Good for people who juggle several things in parallel in their time management.

Supports weekly and monthly tracking periods and custom period is in development.

You can sort projects by any column like recorded time, progress, remaining time.
